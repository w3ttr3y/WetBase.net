Hello world!

This is a repository for code that I reference on my blog.  I have a number of ideas for how to improve things at work; most of them I would consider best practices and  things we should be doing but aren't.

Since I don't have time while at work to do these things, I'm doing them on my own time.  I'm documenting them on my blog, so hopefully I can get feedback.  Then I want to try and convince a couple of developers at work to implement it.  Once there's a couple of implementations, I'll suggest that we adopt it as a standard practice.
